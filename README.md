# Esoteric Compiler
Compiler for a simple esoteric programming language, in particular the minimalistic programming language Brainf***.

Brainf*** was developed by Urban MÃ¼ller as a hypothetical programming language, and it is Turing-complete. It relies on pointers and memory management, which is perfect for a C project.
