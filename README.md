# Esoteric Compiler
Compiler for a simple esoteric programming language, in particular the minimalistic programming language Brainf***.

Brainf*** was developed by Urban MÃ¼ller as a hypothetical programming language, and it is Turing-complete. It relies on pointers and memory management, which is perfect for a C project.

To run, download this C file and run `cat test1.bf | ./a.out` on your Unix-based/Unix-like terminal.
